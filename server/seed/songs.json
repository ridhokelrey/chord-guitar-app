    "lyrics": "I fell by the wayside, like everyone else\nI hate you, I hate you, I hate you\nBut I was just kidding myself\nOur every moment, I start to replace\n'Cause now that they're gone\nAll I hear are the words that I needed to say\nWhen you hurt under the surface\nLike troubled water running cold\nWell, time can heal but this won't\nSo, before you go\nWas there something I could've said\nTo make your heart beat better?\nIf only I'd have known you had a storm to weather\nSo, before you go\nWas there something I could've said\nTo make it all stop hurting?\nIt kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless\nSo, before you go\nWas never the right time, whenever you called\nWent little, by little, by little until there was nothing at all\nOur every moment, I start to replay\nBut all I can think about is seeing that look on your face\nWhen you hurt under the surface\nLike troubled water running cold\nWell, time can heal but this won't\nSo, before you go\nWas there something I could've said\nTo make your heart beat better?\nIf only I'd have known you had a storm to weather\nSo, before you go\nWas there something I could've said\nTo make it all stop hurting?\nIt kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless\nSo, before you go\nWould we be better off by now\nIf I'd let my walls come down?\nMaybe I guess we'll never know\nYou know, you know\nBefore you go\nWas there something I could've said\nTo make your heart beat better?\nIf only I'd have known you had a storm to weather\nSo, before you go\nWas there something I could've said\nTo make it all stop hurting?\nIt kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless\nSo, before you go",
